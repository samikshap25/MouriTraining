| **2**  | String Manipulation   | Write a method that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order.   | String manipulation, iteration          |
| **3**  | Array/List Processing | Find the second smallest element in an integer array without using built-in sorting methods.                 | Array iteration, comparison logic       |
| **4**  | Recursion/Iteration   | Implement a function to calculate the Nth Fibonacci number.                                                  | Loops or Recursion                      |
| **5**  | Searching             | Implement the Binary Search algorithm for a sorted integer array and return the index of the target element. | while loop, mid-point calculation       |
| **6**  | Sorting               | Implement a basic Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.                     | Nested loops, element swapping          |
| **7**  | Mathematical          | Write a program to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer N.                                      | Loops or Recursion                      |
| **8**  | String/Char Count     | Given a string, count the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) present in it (case-insensitive).           | String iteration, character comparison  |
| **9**  | Pattern Printing      | Write a program to print a right-angled triangle star pattern of N rows.                                     | Nested loops                            |
| **10** | Number Property       | Check if a given integer is an Armstrong number.                                                             | Integer manipulation (modulo/division)  |

| Q. No. | Concept            | Implementation Task                                                                                                               | Core Focus                             |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **11** | Classes & Objects  | Create a class named `Book` with fields for title and author; constructor to initialize; method `displayInfo()` to print details. | Class definition, Constructor, Methods |
| **12** | Inheritance        | Define base class `Animal` and subclass `Dog`; override the method `makeSound()`.                                                 | extends, Method Overriding             |
| **13** | Encapsulation      | Modify `Book` class: make fields private and add getter/setter for title.                                                         | private, Getters and Setters           |
| **14** | Polymorphism       | Create abstract class `Shape` with `calculateArea()`; implement in subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`.                           | Abstract classes/methods               |
| **15** | Interfaces         | Define interface `Drivable` with `startEngine()` and `stopEngine()`; implement in class `Car`.                                    | interface, implements                  |
| **16** | Exception Handling | Write method for integer division with try-catch to handle `ArithmeticException`.                                                 | try, catch, Exception hierarchy        |
| **17** | Collections (List) | Create ArrayList of strings; add five names; print only names starting with ‘S’.                                                  | ArrayList, Generics, enhanced for loop |
| **18** | Collections (Map)  | Use HashMap to store three countries and their capitals; iterate to print keys & values.                                          | HashMap, Map.Entry                     |
